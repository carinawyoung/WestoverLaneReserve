# Westover Swim Lane Reservation website

### Background
I'm a swimmer, and my local pool only takes lap lane reservations over the phone or in person. I've wondered how hard it would be to make on online lane-reservation website, so I thought I'd give it a go... 

I decided to use .NET and C#, both new to me, so this was coded with ASP.NET Core and Razor Pages, with some Bootstrap and Javascript, and connected a SQLite database. I've now decided I'm totally a fan of the Razor Pages page-model system over a traditional MVC format! 

I liked the outcome. It could use some tidying and a couple of things should be changed (authorization needs some work) but in general I enjoyed the project and would be happy to use Razor Pages in the future. 

I deployed the app to the cloud, so you can check it out here: https://westoverlanereserve.onrender.com
